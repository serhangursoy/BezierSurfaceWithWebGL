Assignment 3: Realistic Rendering Techniques on Parametric Surfaces

For general UI I used Creative Tim's Now UI Kit which can be seen in here -> https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit
For Click-Drag interface and base of this project, I used this Github page because it was similar to what we want to achieve -> https://github.com/vladamakaric/InteractiveBezierSurface/
For some mathematical operations ( like factorial ) I used Stackoverflow.
For general information about Bezier surfaces and bezier curves I used our textbook and handout that given by our lecturer.
As an extra work, I implemented Parametric Texture Mapping, Bump(Normal) Mapping and Specular Mapping for this assignment. I used several royalty-free textures which can be seen in the Texture folder.
